# Python Practice Problems – Basics to Loops

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python practice programs written in simple script format (no functions) to help understand basic concepts such as loops, conditionals, recursion, patterns, and number operations.

Each program is stored in a separate file for easy reference and execution.
