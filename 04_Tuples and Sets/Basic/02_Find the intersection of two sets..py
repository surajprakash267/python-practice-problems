#✅ 2️⃣ Intersection of Sets

# The intersection of two sets # contains only the elements that are common to both sets.
# Using the intersection() method

l1 = {2, 5, 7, 9, 87, 54, 900, 0, 20}
l2 = {4, 2, 9, 20}
print(l1.intersection(l2))
# OR
print(l1 & l2)

# ✔ Both methods work fine.
# 🟢 Tip: & is faster, while .intersection() is more readable.
